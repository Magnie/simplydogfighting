# What is this?
Just a quick, simple, multiplayer game created using Python 2.7, Kivy 1.9, and PodSixNet. (There's your hint regarding dependencies, however this comes with PodSixNet, so no need to download it.)

# Install
Nothing much to install. Just get the code. Run Server/server.py with Python and Client/main.py with Kivy (unless you have Kivy installed within Python).

To run the server:
```
python server.py
```

To run the client
```
kivy main.py
```

# Can I use the code?
You may use the code in any way as long as you are not using it commercially. If you wish to use it commercially, then please contact me personally for permission.
